This is my first experience with GitHub

I recently graduated from George Mason University with a Bachelor of Science in Geography with a minor in GIS. I consider myself a Geospatial Scientist and Cartographer. I am also an amateur astronomer. I am going to begin working towards my master's in the fall.
